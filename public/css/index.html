      What hasnâ€™t changed: the difficulty of balancing it all. Working parents say they feel <span class="bold">stressed</span>, tired, rushed and short on quality time with their children, friends, partners or hobbies, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
      <p>
      The survey found something of a stress gap by race and <span class="bold">education</span>. College-educated parents and white parents were significantly more likely than other parents to say work-family balance is difficult.
      <p>
      The data are the latest to show that while family structure seems to have permanently changed, public policy, workplace structure and mores have not seemed to adjust to a norm in which both parents work.
